=======================
0. Notes
=======================
Python runs using the help of certain libraries.
In order to run most python applications you must have those libraries installed on your computer.
The installation process is required to take place once, before running the program.
Updating the program will NOT require to follow the installation steps again.

This guide assumes any file you are required to download is placed under the Downloads folder in the C drive.
If this is not the case, any paths used in this guide should be changed accordingly.



======================
1. Install Python
======================
a. Download the latest version of the python installer from: www.python.org/downloads/
* Keep in mind the version of python you install. It will be important later.

b. Download the installer and run it.
* Be sure to add python to PATH when prompted and install for all users.



=======================
2. Install pip
=======================
Pip is a package manager helper for python.

a. Go to the following link: bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

b. Save the file/site as get-pip.py 
* Right click on the web page and click 'Save As', then save the file with the default name under the downloads folter.

c. Using a terminal, execute the command: python C:/Users/[your_user_name]/Downloads/get-pip.py
* To open a terminal search for 'cmd' in the Windows start menu.

d1. Update pip executing the command: pip install --upgrade pip
d2. Update setuptools executing the command: pip install --upgrade setuptools



===================================
3. Install libraries preparation
===================================
Some python libraries we are going to install do not require additional work. This is not the case for all of them.
Here we will do some preparation work in order to have the ability to install the required libraries to run the application.
Step (a) takes some time. You are free to go through with (b) and (c) while waiting for the download to complete.

a. Install c++ build tools
	Make sure you have the latest c++ build tools on your computer. This step is required to install the matplotlib library.
	1. Go to www.visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools
	2. Click the Download Build Tools button
	3. Open the downloaded file.
	4. From the opened window, select the 'C++ build tools option' and deselect all the optional features from the frame on the right.
	5. Click install. Once installed make sure to restart your computer.

b. Install gdal
	GDAL is a library required to install the matplotlib python library.
	1. Go to www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal
	2. Download the correct file from the list. The file you want to download depends on the python version you installed and your CPU type.
	   For example GDAL-3.1.4-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl works for python version 3.7 and on 64bit computers.
	   You are probably using a 64bit computer so look for files containing win_amd64 instead of win32.
	3. Install the file using the following command in a terminal:
	   pip install --user C:/Users/[your_user_name]/Downloads/GDAL-3.1.4-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
	   * Change the filename depending on which file you downloaded.

c. Install fiona
	Fiona is another library required by matplotlib.
	1. Go to www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona
	2. Download the correct file from the list, in the same way you downloaded the gdal file.
	3. Install the file using the command in a terminal:
	   pip install --user C:/Users/[your_user_name]/Downloads/Fiona-1.8.17-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
	   * Change the filename depending on which file you downloaded.



================================
3. Install required libraries.
================================
InstantGIS makes use of certain libraries written in python.
In order to run the application, those libraries must be installed on your computer.

a. Install PyQt5
	In a terminal, run the following command: pip install --user pyqt5

b. Install matplotlib
	In a terminal, run the following command: pip install --user matplotlib

c. Install some windows related libraries
	In a terminal, run the following command: pip install --user pypiwin32

d. Install geopandas
	In a terminal, run the following command: pip install --user geopandas

e. Install PyShp
	In a terminal, run the following command: pip install --user pyshp



=======================
4. End
=======================
You are ready to run the application.
To run the application, run the 'InstantGIS.bat' file from the InstantGIS directory.
* Don't close the terminal that appears while executing the .bat file, as it closes the application itself.
