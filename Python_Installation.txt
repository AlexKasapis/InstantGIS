0. Note
=======================
Python runs using the help of certain libraries.
In order to run most python applications you must have those libraries installed on your computer.
The installation process is required to take place once, before running the program.
Updating the program will not require any more of this work.


======================
1. Install Python
======================
a. Download the latest version of the python installer from: www.python.org/downloads/
*Keep in mind the version of python you install. It will be important later.

b. Download the installer and run it.
* Be sure to add python to PATH, when prompted and install for all users.


=======================
2. Install pip
=======================
Pip is a package manager helper for python.

a. Go to the following link: bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
b. Save the file/site as get-pip.py
c. Using a terminal, execute the command: python /path/to/file/get-pip.py
d. Update pip executing the command: pip install --upgrade pip


================================
3. Install required libraries.
================================
InstantGIS uses the power of certain libraries written in python.
In order to run the application, those libraries must be installed on your computer.

a. Install PyQt5
In a terminal, run the following command: pip install --user pyqt5

b. Install matplotlib
In a terminal, run the following command: pip install --user matplotlib

c. Install some windows related libraries
In a terminal, run the following command: pip install --user pypiwin32


d. Install geopandas.
Geopandas is a little trickier but the last step towards running the application.
You will need to manually install 2 library packages: gdal and fiona.
Install them in this order.

== gdal
Download the correct file from: www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal
The file you want to download depends on (a) the python version you installed and (b).
For example GDAL‑3.1.4‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl works for python version 3.7 and on 64bit computers.
You probably use a 64bit computer so look for files containing win_amd64 instead of win32.
After downloading the file, install it using the following command in a terminal:
pip install --user ~/Downloads/GDAL-3.1.4-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
The last piece of data, ~/Downloads/GDAL-3.1.4-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl, specifies which file to install, so be sure to enter the path right.

== fiona
Download the correct file from: www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona
Install the file using the command: pip install --user ~/Downloads/Fiona-1.8.17-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl

== geopandas
Now you are free to install geopandas, executing the following command:
pip install --user geopandas


=======================
4. End
=======================
You are ready to run the application.
